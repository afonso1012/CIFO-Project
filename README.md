# Wedding Seating Arrangement Optimization using Genetic Algorithms

## Project Overview

Weddings are often both emotionally and financially demanding events, with guest seating arrangements being a critical component of the planning process. This project addresses the challenge of automating seating plans by optimizing guest placements based on interpersonal relationship scores, with the objective of maximizing overall guest satisfaction.

We formulate this as a **combinatorial optimization problem** and solve it using a customized **Genetic Algorithm (GA)**. The GA incorporates tailored genetic operators for selection, crossover, and mutation, and is fine-tuned using a structured parameter search. Its performance is benchmarked against two other metaheuristics—**Hill Climbing (HC)** and **Simulated Annealing (SA)**—with the GA consistently delivering superior results.

> This project was developed for the **Computational Intelligence for Optimization** course (2024/2025) at **NOVA IMS**, as part of the Master's in **Data Science and Advanced Analytics**, specialization in **Data Science**. It explores the real-world application of evolutionary algorithms for solving complex optimization problems.
