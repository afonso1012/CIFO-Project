    "\n",
    "In a typical **fitness proportionate selection** (also known as **roulette wheel selection**), individuals are selected based on their fitness values, with higher fitness values having a greater chance of being chosen. In our optimization problem, however, the fitness values can range from **negative** (indicating conflicts) to **positive** (indicating good relationships between guests).\n",
    "\n",
    "To adapt the selection process to handle **negative fitness values**, we introduce the following modifications:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Handling Negative Fitness**:\n",
    "   - Negative fitness values (e.g., -1000) represent undesirable relationships between guests and are valid in our case.\n",
    "   - However, to ensure that these negative values don't completely block a solution from being selected, we **normalize** the fitness values by adding an **offset** to make all fitness values non-negative.\n",
    "   - The offset is the **absolute value of the minimum fitness** if it's negative, ensuring that all fitness values become positive or zero without altering the relative fitness ranking of solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Fitness Normalization**:\n",
    "   - For each individual, we add the **offset** (if necessary) to their fitness value to ensure it's non-negative.\n",
    "   - This ensures that individuals with negative fitness still have a chance to be selected but are less likely to be chosen compared to those with higher (positive) fitness.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Roulette Wheel Selection**:\n",
    "   - After normalizing the fitness values, the selection process proceeds as usual, with higher fitness solutions having a higher probability of being selected.\n",
    "   - By adding the offset, we make sure that **negative fitness values** don't result in zero or near-zero chances of selection, allowing them to contribute to the evolutionary process."

It swaps a segment between two parent solutions and builds offspring by preserving the order and position of elements while avoiding duplicates. In our implementation, we adapted PMX to work with the wedding seating format by flattening table arrangements into 1D lists, applying PMX, and then converting them back. We carefully resolved conflicts during crossover by mapping duplicate entries to valid unused guests, ensuring that each guest appears exactly once in the final seating—maintaining valid, non-repetitive arrangements."

    "The Order Crossover (OX) is a genetic algorithm operator also designed for permutation problems, such as our guest seating arrangements. It selects a contiguous block of seats from one parent and preserves both the relative order and positional integrity of the remaining guests by filling in, in sequence, from the other parent’s list and skipping any guest already included. In our implementation, we adapt OX to the wedding format by flattening each table layout into a single list, choosing two crossover points, copying the segment from Parent 1 into Offspring 1 (and vice versa for Offspring 2), then rotating through the other parent’s flattened list to fill the empty slots while avoiding duplicates. Finally, we reshape the 1D offspring lists back into the original table structure, guaranteeing a complete, non-repetitive seating plan."
